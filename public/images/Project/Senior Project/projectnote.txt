My senior project was something I dedicated about 4 months to focus on aspects of design that ive always like to create cool stuff. I wanted to focus on using Adobe Illustator, Photoshop, Lightroom, Procreate, 3D printing and laser cutting.
This was the beginning of Crasher Studios, this is when I knew I wanted to continue to make cool stuff for both hardcore and casual fans from all corner of the world. I wanted to create unique and well-crafted displays that any fan could be proud to own and display. After many failed attempts and things going wrong I learned a lot about perfecting my method after each setback.
It was a lot of work making things that require such different production methods in a large quantity but the pay off of seeing it all come together was well worth it.
