Made this design for Some Slight when they first started releasing shirts and they let me know about wanting to make a Ace x Dunkin design. After some concepts we got a design that we thought people both casual and hardcore fans would love.
Hoping in the future we can continue to craft similar designs that can continue to capture the love and attention of the One Piece and anime fandom.
