It was truly an honor to make a collection of shorts for SomeSlight Clothing and One piece because it's probably my favorite show of all time.
Introducing the Wano Impact Collection – where anime meets athletic style in a fusion inspired by the impactful frames of One Piece during the Wano Arc. The breathable mesh fabric ensures comfort, while the bold designs capture the essence of Wano’s vibrant and dramatic aesthetic. Embrace the spirit of the Straw Hat Pirates as you channel the determination of Luffy and the formidable strength of Zoro. With these even you could even make the King of the Pirates jealous.
